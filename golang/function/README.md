Go supports first class functions, higher-order functions, user-defined function types, function literals, closures, and multiple return values.

This rich feature set supports a functional programming style in a strongly typed language.

User-defined function types
In Go, functions can be passed around just like any other value. A function's type signature describes the types of its arguments and return values.

Higher-order functions
A function can use other functions as arguments and return values.

Function literals and closures
Anonymous functions can be declared in Go, as in this example. Function literals are closures: they inherit the scope of the function in which they are declared.

Multiple return values
Go functions can return multiple values.
